# Application of Machine Learning Techniques to Classify Web Services

This 
paper proposes machine learning models that could be used 
to classify these web services viz., K-Nearest Neighbors 
(KNN), Naïve Bayes (Gaussian Naïve Bayes Classifier), 
Kernel Support Vector Machine Classifier (Kernel SVM), 
linear SVM, Decision Trees and Random Forests. The QWS 
(Quality Web Services) dataset has been used for 
classification and analysis
